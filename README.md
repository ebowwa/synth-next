# Synth-Next: A Python FastAPI and Next.js 14 App Router Project

## Backstory

This past weekend, I participated in the X (formerly Twitter) hackathon. It was an exciting and challenging experience, where I had the opportunity to explore the wide breadth of human interactions, civic engagement, community, and innovation.

While I had fun and gained valuable insights, I feel like I may have gotten a bit too caught up in the human side of the experience, which ultimately impacted the project's progress. I was excited to work with my assigned team and even created a Discord server to engage with my new collaborators, but unfortunately, I received little to no response from them.

Undeterred, I spent the week brainstorming and preparing for the final day. When the time came, my original team was absent, and I was paired with a new group. This new group included two other participants:

1. **Enthusiastic and Uncompromising Partner**: This individual had been working on the project all week and had a strong, enthusiastic personality. They even yelled at me at one point (which was quite amusing). Around 2 PM, they decided to work on the project entirely on their own.

2. **Curious but Disengaged Partner**: This partner, known as @echo4eva, was an early Python developer who was more interested in the "how" than the final result. They expressed that they weren't much of a help and wanted to go home around 1 AM.

3. **Promising but Unprepared Partner**: @khaljughaiman, an interesting fellow who I would be willing to work with again. They had some Python experience, but they weren't fully ready to tackle the problems at hand.

Ultimately, I feel like I faced the challenge mostly on my own, and the only part of the project that was demo'd to the judges was the front-end landing page that I had created.

While I'm disappointed in the outcome, I've learned some valuable lessons. If I had focused less on the scale of the project and more on the actual result, my team and I might have been able to deliver a more polished and successful project.

## Project Overview

This repository integrates a large language model (LLM) from Mindsdb within a Next.js backend, which is fully powered by Python endpoints and a client-side web server.
